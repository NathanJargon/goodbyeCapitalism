# GoodbyeCapitalism
This website is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It presents a dynamic and interactive user experience centered around the phrase "Goodbye Capitalism." When the user clicks on this text, it triggers an event that causes the text to move to a different position on the screen. The movement is randomized, providing an element of surprise and unpredictability with each click.

The website incorporates various styling elements using CSS to enhance its visual appeal. The background color is white, creating a clean and minimalistic backdrop. The text itself is styled with a large font size of 48 pixels, appearing prominently on the screen. It also has a text shadow effect, adding depth and a subtle visual effect.

The JavaScript code controls the behavior and functionality of the website. It includes a timer that counts down from 60 seconds. When the user clicks on the "Goodbye Capitalism" text, it triggers the movement animation and updates the score. If the score reaches 1, the timer starts counting down. Once the timer reaches zero, a completion message is displayed, congratulating the user on their achievements and expressing the final score.

This website offers an engaging and interactive experience, combining the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and dynamic environment centered around the phrase "Goodbye Capitalism."
